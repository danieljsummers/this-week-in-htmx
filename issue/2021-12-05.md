What do locality of behaviour, scripting and poetry have in common? I gave 
_hyperscript by @htmx_org another chance and I like what I see!! #CraftCMS

Fubarrr: [Re. Daniel - East TN: Part 3 (post 3) is up...]
  "...  demonstrates that htmx is a true batteries-included SPA framework" üëà 
  now there's a phrase you don't hear everyday üòÅ üëç [üëç1]

## _hyperscript is looking for contributors to help with documentation

{{#> chatlog time='20211201T1826+03' url='725789699527933952/796428329531605032/915625011644084264'}}
1cg: [...] The current docs start off with async-transparency, since that was 
  the interesting technical challenge we had solved just prior to writing them.
  It's very cool, but it's not the main point of hyperscript. I'll take another
  crack at it with a "what the thing does and why you should care" perspective.
  Or maybe I should let someone else write the docs?

## RichardG launched Comedy Wham with htmx, _hyperscript and Sprig

{{#> chatlog time='20211129T2019+03' url='725789699527933952/909436816388669530/914928551436894209'}}
RichardG: big thanks to @Deniz Ak≈üim≈üek @1cg and I'm sure i'm forgetting 
  someone, but finally launched a revised site over the break and couldn't have
  done it w/o help on Sprig/htmx and hyperscript! comedywham.com/events (and 
  the related submission form)

## HTML as a database?!

{{#> chatlog time='20211130T0757+03' url='725789699527933952/725789747212976259/915104232867250246'}}
mobilesped@yahoo.com: To keep this html only thing going...What about a 
  database that stores info as nested html and then returns that data without 
  any processing needed to display it on the page. Like graph but strictly html
  structure. HTMQL???
lllama: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hierarchical_database_model
lllama: Reminded me of this from a while back: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=28736405
craigrodway: Sounds like a filesystem of .html files! üòâ
Deniz Ak≈üim≈üek: this has the wonderfully cursed advantage of being able to use 
  CSS as a query language [üòÜ4]
Deniz Ak≈üim≈üek: I don't think HTML as a database is the best idea, but will 
  defend HTML as an API
36864: We used to call this a "website"
lllama: HTML as the engine of application state perhaps? üòÑ
byteface: i've been toying with this idea using range requests. I wanted to 
  make an infinite scroller using range requests to a gigantic static dom. you
  basically have to store a map of css or tag positions to bytes. currently
  trying to work one in to my proxy

## Johan (Commspace) is still using intercooler.js

{{#> chatlog time='20211130T1656+03' url='725789699527933952/780786399704121365/915239882207666226'}}
Fubarrr: @1cg is there a default intercooler history item cache limit... and/or
  a way to configure the max cache entries, like we have available in htmx 
  (htmx.config.historyCacheSize Defaults to 10)?
1cg: holy moly
1cg: looks like it is permanently set to 20: https://github.com/bigskysoftware/intercooler-js/blob/1addb24d57cd24861fa5963a3ebf76c587651307/src/intercooler.js#L1939
1cg: we could cut a new release (!!!) to make this configurable
{{/ chatlog}}

They didn't end up using a new release, since Commspace was using a custom 
build anyway. However, it's a good reminder that Intercooler is still supported
(to the extent that any non-profit open source project can be "supported", at 
least).


## bpamiri#9470 is looked into using htmx with ColdFusion

{{#> chatlog time='20211130T1704+03' url='https://discord.com/channels/725789699527933952/725789747212976259/915241805426090024'}}
bpamiri: I just came across htmx last week and am trying to consume as much 
  info about it as I can. I come from a ColdFusion background, using CFML (the
  language on the backend) on CFWheels (a framework for CFML inspired by 
  Rails). I'm very excited about finding out about this project.
