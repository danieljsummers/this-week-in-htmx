## missing.css: A CSS framework from the htmx community

> missing.css is the missing CSS library that we all wished existed:
>
>   - It starts with decent default styling for vanilla HTML, akin to classless
>     CSS libraries
>   - It offers a small set of components based on purely standard, semantic
>     HTML, utilizing ARIA where appropriate, such as tabs.
>   - Finally, it offers a small & curated set of class-based utilities for
>     tweaking the styling of a site
>
> The objective of missing.css is to minimize the neccessary intervention in the
> HTML by allowing developers to start with a good out of the box experience,
> then build common components using plain, semantic HTML and then, only if
> necessary, apply a minimal number of classes to achieve.

## demo.htmx.org: a demo environment for htmx snippets

Simply drop `<script src="https://demo.htmx.org"></script>` into an HTML file
and you'll be set up with htmx, \_hyperscript and a mock server. Here's an
example---a server- and client-side counter:

<figure class="fig">

  ~~~ html
  <script src="https://demo.htmx.org"></script>

  <h2>Server Counter</h2>
  <output id="server-n">0</output>
  <button type="button" hx-post="/n?inc=1"  hx-target="#server-n">+</button>
  <button type="button" hx-post="/n?inc=-1" hx-target="#server-n">-</button>
  <!-- Server -->
  <script>let serverInt = 0;</script>
  <template url="/n">${serverInt += Number(inc)}</template>

  <h2>Client Counter</h2>
  <output id="client-n">0</output>
  <button type="button"
  	_="on click increment #client-n's textContent">+</button>
  <button type="button"
  	_="on click decrement #client-n's textContent">-</button>
  ~~~

## vscode-hyperscript has experimental Sublime support

{{#>chatlog time='20220217T1427+03' url='725789699527933952/796428329531605032/943831075229147177'}}
gnat: There any syntax highlighting available for sublime?
Fubarrr: [Re. gnat: There any syntax...] I only know of VS Code. @Deniz
  Ak≈üim≈üek will know
Deniz Ak≈üim≈üek: Nope
Deniz Ak≈üim≈üek: but I'm pretty sure it uses the same format as vscode, so it
  shouldn't be too hard to convert
{{/chatlog}}

Indeed, it wasn't. There were some cryptic errors, but @gnat helped me debug
over discord for a day, and wrote an injection syntax that makes it work inside
HTML too --- thanks! üíô

{{#>chatlog time='' url=''}}
gnat: So the basic laymens instructions:
  1. Open Sublime
  2. Preferences -> Browse Packages...
  3. Copy both files into User directory.
  4. Restart Sublime
  5. View -> Syntax -> User -> HTML (_hyperscript)
{{/chatlog}}

The "both files" being talked about are `syntaxes/_hyperscript.tmLanguage` and
`HTML (_hyperscript).sublime-syntax` in the [vscode-hyperscript repo]. (I'll be
looking into packaging it).

<aside>

vscode-hyperscript is also seeking maintainers.

Deniz Ak≈üim≈üek: speaking of: anyone lmk if you can lend a hand for the
  vscode-hyperscript extension (i don't run vs code as often anymore). dw if
  you have no experience, i didn't either & i can help you get familiar with the
  code

## Dark Star: a Python web framework with filesystem routing

{{#>chatlog time='20220209T0153+03' url='725789699527933952/864934037381971988/940742050847031316'}}
lllama: Hello all - just a little curio that I've put together:
  https://lllama.github.io/dark-star/
lllama: It's (yet another) "framework" using Starlette. I got thinking about
  Locality of Behaviour (thanks to @1cg) and wondered if you could put the
  templates right next to the code for a view. The idea is that a fair chunk of
  the boilerplate is removed and replaced by putting files in the filesystem.
  (kinda like a webserver - old things are new again.)
lllama: And that's basically it. But it does get you up and running fairly
  quickly. And having little pieces of HTML living at URLs is nice and easy.
  Seems to fit in with what we're doing here.
lllama: I'm dropping it here in case anyone fancies a play and giving some
  feedback. If I get the chance then I'll try and put together a Real World
  (https://realworld-docs.netlify.app/) example - that should help to shake out
  any issues. Or show that the idea doesn't really work üòÑ
