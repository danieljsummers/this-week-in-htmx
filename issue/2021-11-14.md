## Mother of All Demos, brought to you by Commspace

Fubarrr: Ok, time for a bit of show and tell! We've just added a command palette
  into our **React** app, so I thought I'd show you what a TRUE SPA looks like. 
  You'll also see a bit of our async backend processing behaviour, complete with
  UI progress bars, individual list item status updates, etc. 
  https://youtu.be/zHoAwVcSLdE [👍4] [😲2]
Fubarrr: Ok ok... just before @1cg has a heart attack - that ain't no React app 
  ☝️😁   That's a good old traditional MVC Java app, powered by htmx and 
  hyperscript 💪 All of the page loading and most of the JS UI widget behaviour 
  is also driven by htmx and/or hyperscript. There's some gratuitous web socket 
  usage to update the individual table line item statuses during the latter part
  of the clip ... but for the rest it's html fragments all the way, complete 
  with URL pushing and history support (oh, and not a single full page refresh 
  anywhere of course) 
Fubarrr: (no idea why the video preview image isn't showing up 🤷‍♂️ )
{{/ chatlog}}

Now, THAT'S what I call a 
<b style="letter-spacing:.1em; font-style:italic; color:#0f8; 
transform:rotate(-5deg); display:inline-block;">TRUE SPA</b>!
My chatlog widget doesn't support link embeds anyway, so you're fine :)

If this PR gets merged, htmx will have a lot more cred... (not that we need it,
of course)

💙 to Craft CMS!


## Daniel's F# library, Giraffe.Htmx, was released

{{#> chatlog time='20211109T0244+03' url='725789699527933952/725789747212976259/907415387665227807'}}

> Giraffe.Htmx provides extensions that facilitate using htmx on the server 
> side, primarily reading and setting headers. Giraffe.ViewEngine.Htmx provides
> attributes and helpers to produce views that utilize htmx. Both can be
> installed from NuGet via standard methods.

## Big updates to the `show` and `hide` commands in _hyperscript

{{#> chatlog time='20211110T1855+03' url='725789699527933952/796428329531605032/908022174034563082'}}
1cg: one common pattern I note is the
  ~~~ hyperscript
  if cond
    show
  else
    hide
  end
  ~~~
  pattern
1cg: is there a good syntactic way to wrap that up?
1cg: `show <target> when <cond>`?
--- {{ datetime '20211111T2223+03' }}
benpate: There’s so much good stuff happening in this thread. You’re all right 
  on target, working to make things better.
  
  I’ll add one small idea, that code that reads in a more declarative way is 
  often easier to understand. I know hyperscript is not a declarative language, 
  but there are a few bits that blue the lines.
  
  So, I really like syntax along the lines of show .foo when it’s innerHTML 
  contains “bar”.
  
  I think some kind of “undo” stack might also be helpful here. Something like a 
  function that performs its operation, and retina a function that can restore 
  things to their previous state.   I shared an article along these lines 
  before, from the go community. Let me know if it would be helpful to pull up 
  again.
Deniz Akşimşek:
  ~~~ hyperscript
  -- one line search, fits within column 80
  on input show <li/> in me when its textContent contains my.value
  ~~~
Deniz Akşimşek: [Re. benpate: There's so much good stuff...]
  ~~~ hyperscript
  action: add .foo to me
  ...
  rollback action
  ~~~

`show thing when condition` has been implemented and will be there in the new
release. As for everything else, that's where you all come in.


## Ben Croker wants IDE tooling for _hyperscript

{{#> tweet author='Ben Croker' url='ben_pylo/1457824185514872843' time='20211109T1235+03'}}
As a developer, I see the appeal of @Alpine_JS, but \_hyperscript by @htmx_org
makes a compelling case for readability and “Locality of Behavior”. The main
downside is having to learn a new grammar, and this is where autosuggest can
help, now we just need someone to build it!!
{{/ tweet}}

There's an unwritten rule about suggesting features on the htmx discord... but 
then, Ben did buy me coffees.


## kirbyzone and yours truly had a grand debate

{{#> chatlog time='20211114T2341+03' url='725789699527933952/796428329531605032/909543625371840512'}}
kirbyzone: Would you forgive me if I became the ‘voice of dissent’ here, as far 
  as let goes?…

{{/ chatlog}}

It's a little too long to copy here, but you can read it all on the Discord and
pitch in with your own opinions. 

(Be warned: If your opinion is good, you will probably be asked to implement it. 
I joined the server for REST memes and look where I ended up...)


## Carson reviewed a React codebase

{{#> tweet author='htmx.org' url='htmx_org/1458114703444660226' time='20211109T1950+03'}}
i recently reviewed a moderately sized react/graphql/rails code base done by
very competent, senior developers

i have never been more bullish on htmx

*never*

## Forum vs. Discord?

{{#> chatlog time='20211109T2145+03' url='725789699527933952/725789747212976259/907702512935653386'}}
alfonsrv: Use forums rather than Slack/Discord to support developer community: <https://www.mooreds.com/wordpress/archives/3451>
alfonsrv: Some interesting thoughts here. Thought I'd share
--- {{ datetime '20210911T2239+03' }} ---
kirbyzone: Kirby uses Discourse - you can see it here: https://forum.getkirby.com/
1cg: ok, that's what we tried to use
1cg: it got shut down for lack of use 😑
kirbyzone: I suspect your experience would probably be different now - based on 
  the amount of traffic I’ve seen here in the past week or two.
1cg: 🙂
1cg: OK, maybe in the newyear [👍1] [🎉1]
benpate: We do have several places for discussions already -- Github, Discord, 
  Stack Overflow, Reddit.  I'm all for having the best tools for the job (and 
  Discord is NOT great for many uses) but adding yet another channel should be 
  done carefully. 
benpate: I think the biggest issue right now is that questions and issues don't 
  immediately go to Github or Stack Overflow.
