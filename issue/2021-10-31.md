## Rashad released lucid-htmx for Haskell developers

We talked about Rashad's htmx/Haskell plans in [our last issue][]. The package 
is now out:

{{#> chatlog time='20211029T2040+03' url='725789699527933952/725789747212976259/903518722034118696'}}
Rashad: <https://www.loom.com/share/dffdf15baa3045ea9eea562bd88cc1b3?sharedAppSource=personal_library>
  
  HIGHLY RECOMMEND WATCHING THE LOOM AT 1.5 ~ 2 times speed. I talk slow. Skip 
  to the 58 minute mark to see lucid-htmx immediately. Watch the rest if you're 
  interested in Haskell web dev.
  
  An overview of lucid-htmx. I've recently published the package to hackage, 
  the Haskell package manager. Check it out here: <https://hackage.haskell.org/package/lucid-htmx>
  
  Documentation here: <https://hackage.haskell.org/package/lucid-htmx-0.1.0.0/docs/Lucid-HTMX.html>
  
  I recommend watching the loom video at 1.5 ~ 2 times speed. I talk slow and 
  the video is long but watching it at a higher speed, I think it's a good 
  pace. If you want to skip straight to the htmx stuff, skip to the 58 minute 
  mark. Otherwise, I take a dive into web dev in Haskell and answer some 
  interesting questions like how to query a database in Haskell, how to 
  implement a server in Haskell, and what are some annoying things about 
  Haskell development. 
Rashad: Code for the example in the loom video can be found here: <https://github.com/rashadg1030/haskell-htmx-examples/blob/main/app/Main.hs>

## We discussed debugging/inspection tools for htmx

{{#> chatlog time='20211027T1734+03' url='725789699527933952/725789747212976259/902928361951727667'}}
gone: Is there a way to get the code that handles the debug info in the bottom 
  of the documentation examples?
gone: the count of server requests + outgoing data and response
gone: it would be very useful to drop into an app as a debug tool
Deniz Ak≈üim≈üek: that's built into the mock server that HTMX uses, however a 
  similar thing could be built for real server requests
--- {{ datetime '20211029T1341+03' }} ---
BenCroker: Since you're here @Deniz Ak≈üim≈üek, I have an idea to share: a htmx 
  devtools browser extension. \
  This could log requests in its own devtools window, including things such as 
  the request params and headers, response time and payload, as well as a 
  visual overlay of the swapped mark-up in the browser window. Kind of similar 
  to the request viewer on the htmx examples pages, but as a browser 
  extension.\
  VueJS has a very powerful devtool browser extension, for example, see the quick demo at https://youtu.be/odKVakhMk1o?t=73
Deniz Ak≈üim≈üek: <https://discord.com/channels/725789699527933952/725789747212976259/902928361951727667>
  It was discussed before, and I think it's a wonderful idea. I bet we could 
  implement a time-travel debugger like Redux, for the framework war coolness 
  points...
Deniz Ak≈üim≈üek: I'll stop talking about this before it gets assigned to me [üëÜ1] [üòÜ1]

## htmx made it to the Twitter "Explore" page

{{#> chatlog time='20211027T1751+03' url='725789699527933952/725789747212976259/902932628435505182'}}

## Daniel used HTML as an API for a side project

{{#> chatlog time='20211028T2153+03' url='725789699527933952/725789747212976259/903355901237420062'}}  
Daniel - East TN: For a (paid) side project, I got asked to expose some 
  information "however I want" - they're going to integrate it into a dashboard
  app. They're getting 2 endpoints - one with an HTML table of the data 
  (fragment), and one that wraps the table in a document with minimalist 
  styling. They can style it, or they can use my black/white/gray striping with 
  hover highlighting. So easy! \
  _Now, I wait for the consumers to say "Huh - how do we swap this into our placeholder?" LOL_  
Deniz Ak≈üim≈üek: thing that should exist: a convenient way to scrape html tables  
benpate: [Re. Deniz Ak≈üim≈üek: thing that should exist...] Yes, very cool idea.
  Are you thinking you'd want to scrape the tables into a Javascript array?
  That should be pretty easy to do in JS or Hyperscript.  Would this be used in 
  htmx, or somewhere else?  
Deniz Ak≈üim≈üek: in programmatic clients of an html api  
benpate: Yup.  
Deniz Ak≈üim≈üek:  preferably with support for scope=rowgroup
Deniz Ak≈üim≈üek: and rowspan  
Deniz Ak≈üim≈üek: colgroup might make sense too, thinking about it

Daniel - East TN: [Re. Deniz Ak≈üim≈üek: thing that should exist...] It does in F#

## <del>Daniel</del> pedantic bloggers asked about how to write htmx & _hyperscript

{{#> chatlog time='20211027T2117+03' url='725789699527933952/725789747212976259/902984478740328488'}}
Daniel - East TN: The official name of this project/technology - is it "HTMX" 
  or "htmx"? (Pedantic bloggers want to know!)
1cg: htmx, lowercase [üëç2]
Deniz Ak≈üim≈üek: our non-existent styleguide at This Week in HTMX mandates 
  lowercase (despite the name of the site itself) [üòÜ1] 
Daniel - East TN: Cool - I... uh, I mean... pedantic bloggers wanted to make 
  sure they got it right. üôÇ
1cg: also, hyperscript is _hyperscript, and the underscore is silent [üòÜ1]
1cg: under no circumstances should hyperscript be spelled hyperscript [üòÜ1]
Deniz Ak≈üim≈üek: _hyperscript, worsening your markdown experience since [however
  long it's existed]
1cg: _worsening
Deniz Ak≈üim≈üek: ah yes, my favorite programming language \\_hyperscript
Daniel - East TN: ü§£

## Richard used prism-hyperscript

{{#> chatlog time='20211029T1932+03' url='725789699527933952/796428329531605032/903682626970353775'}}
RichardG ‚Äî Yesterday at 7:32 PM @1cg that prism link is gold. thank you again üôÇ helped me wrangle:
  
  <figure>

  ~~~ hyperscript
  on load 
    set global submitReady to false
    repeat until submitReady is true
      wait 1s then
      if #contactName.value != '' and #contactEmail.value != ''
        remove .bg-grey-700 from #submitButton
        add    .bg-red-800  to   #submitButton
        set my disabled to false
        set submitReady to true
      end
    end
  ~~~
  </figure>

If you go to <https://prism-hyperscript.dz4k.com>, you will find a textarea 
where you can type any _hyperscript code and it will be syntax highlighted.
