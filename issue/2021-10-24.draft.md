## tinycode2 is using htmx with microfrontends

{{#> chatlog time='20211020T1629+3' url='725789699527933952/725789747212976259/900375210132373544' }}
tinycode2: Is there a way to bind URL to changes to page state via htmx?
alejandros: You can update the URL from the server side using the HX-Push
  header <https://htmx.org/reference/#response_headers> and you can also do it 
  on the client side via htmx-push-url <https://htmx.org/attributes/hx-push-url/>
tinycode2: Ok but what if I have several areas which update different parts of 
  the URL?
tinycode2: E.g. query string arguments
1cg: ideally they would each have a hx-push-url that updated the local URL 
  appropriately or relied on the server to return the correct URL in an HX-Push
  header
alejandros: For complex cases, I use the header. htmx always sends the current 
  URL in the request headers so you can take that, change it, then send it 
  back. [ðŸ”¥1]
tinycode2: In my case I'm using micro-frontends so responsibility for query 
  string components (and html rendering) isn't centralised in a single backend
  service. I guess I'll need to build some sort of aggregating proxy server 
  which does this :/
tinycode2:  Actually the model you suggested should also work for 
  microfrrontends @alejandros

RichardG: Yes indeed, is fun ðŸ™‚ and the syntax highlighting in VSCode helps a 
  ton
RichardG: Phpstorm doesn't seem to have it, that I can find?
