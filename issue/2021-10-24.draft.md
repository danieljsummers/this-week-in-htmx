## tinycode2 is using htmx with microfrontends

{{#> chatlog time='20211020T1629+3' url='725789699527933952/725789747212976259/900375210132373544' }}
tinycode2: Is there a way to bind URL to changes to page state via htmx?
alejandros: You can update the URL from the server side using the HX-Push
  header <https://htmx.org/reference/#response_headers> and you can also do it 
  on the client side via htmx-push-url <https://htmx.org/attributes/hx-push-url/>
tinycode2: Ok but what if I have several areas which update different parts of 
  the URL?
tinycode2: E.g. query string arguments
1cg: ideally they would each have a hx-push-url that updated the local URL 
  appropriately or relied on the server to return the correct URL in an HX-Push
  header
alejandros: For complex cases, I use the header. htmx always sends the current 
  URL in the request headers so you can take that, change it, then send it 
  back. [ðŸ”¥1]
tinycode2: In my case I'm using micro-frontends so responsibility for query 
  string components (and html rendering) isn't centralised in a single backend
  service. I guess I'll need to build some sort of aggregating proxy server 
  which does this :/
tinycode2:  Actually the model you suggested should also work for 
  microfrrontends @alejandros

## Daniel made Bootstrap modals work with htmx

{{#> chatlog time='20201021T1622+03' url='725789699527933952/725789747212976259/900735911430598726'}}
Daniel - East TN: FWIW - this is "doing it wrong". I put an hx-get on the 
  button that launches the modal, targeting the body of the modal; then, I 
  return the HTML fragment from the server. All the htmx stuff works like it 
  should again. ðŸ™‚

## An inconsistency in _hyperscript syntax was fixed

Currently, the `send` command can dispatch events on other elements, but 
`trigger` cannot:

  ~~~ _hyperscript
  send evt            -- works, dispatches on "me"
  send evt to #elt    -- works, dispatches on #elt
  trigger evt         -- works, dispatches on "me"
  trigger evt on #elt -- syntax error!
  ~~~

This will no longer be the case in the next release of _hyperscript.

## Richard appreciated syntax highlighting for _hyperscript

{{#> chatlog time='20211018T2154+03' url='725789699527933952/796428329531605032/899732227053719573' }}
RichardG: Yes indeed, is fun ðŸ™‚ and the syntax highlighting in VSCode helps a 
  ton
RichardG: Phpstorm doesn't seem to have it, that I can find?

![Some _hyperscript code inside of HTML, nicely highlighted](/assets/2021-10-24/vscode-hyperscript.png)

The _hyperscript plugin for Visual Studio Code adds syntax highlighting, even
for code embedded in HTML! Try it out:

I've also just started writing a tree-sitter grammar, for those who are into
_that_ sort of thing:
