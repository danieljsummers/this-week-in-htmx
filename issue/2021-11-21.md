JargonTheTerrible: Hello, dropping in from [openXtalk.org][] where I've been 
  arguing my head off trying to convince them to do what you are already doing 
  here. But what we have that you don't have is a sexy drag and drop GUI and I 
  wanted to say "Hey lets work together!"...You can get the livecode community 
  edition here: https://archive.org/search.php?query=creator%3A%22LiveCode%2C+Inc.%22 
  and after some poking around you might come to a conclusion of how developers
  could make the same thing entirely in a browser. At the user level 
  obfuscating all that HTML you are strangling hypertalk with until it's 
  compiled for distribution.

benpate: I'm currently (slowly) working on a WYSIWYG tool for regular people to
  make their own web pages (aren't we all?) [...] I think tools like this 
  should make it easy for professional designers to put up strong guard rails 
  around their work, while giving regular people enough customization to make 
  it feel "personal".

While _hyperscript takes a lot from its ancestor HyperTalk, it's designed for
HTML through-and-through. However, it's also designed to be extensible --- if
you can write JavaScript, you can add features to _hyperscript. An end-user app
builder like HyperCard for our decade is a very noble (and fun) goal.

Deniz AkÅŸimÅŸek: _hyperscript / openxtalk / livecode / gui builder thought dump
  
  I shared this with @1cg earlier and he mentioned the possibility of adding 
  _hyperscript to it: <https://mmm.page/>
  
  The dev didn't seem interested in that, but it's the first page builder I've
  liked since I learned HTML. One impression I have of consumer dev tools -- 
  and this might be way off, feel free to correct me @JargonTheTerrible -- is 
  that they eventually get used for professional software, and become more and
  more catered to that (maybe because those people can pay). Both mmm and _hs 
  have an "intentionally unscalable" approach that I like.

1cg: @Deniz AkÅŸimÅŸek I have now promised @andrew.welch that I am going to speak
  competently on "intentional unscaleabilityishness" so you are going to have 
  to explain what it is to me thank u

WE CAN'T LET HIM KEEP GETTING AWAY WITH THIS.


## Josef Erben used htmx to build hoarddit.com

> Feeling empowered by the good documentation and useful examples on the HTMX

>
> In a rush of euphoria, we decided to HTMXize the whole project; liking, 
> unliking, selling, buying and updating the balance. It went quite well, we
> implemented all those features without duplicating code in the backend and on
> the client.

> HTMX truly feels like an extension of HTML, something that should have been
> standardized and included in HTML a while ago.

Fubarrr: [...] I can SO relate to this feeling ðŸ˜‚â€¦ thatâ€™s exactly how it went

## htmx vs _hyperscript, when to use which?

{{#> chatlog time='20211117T0241+03' url='725789699527933952/725789747212976259/910313574491107370'}}
kirbyzone: @ajusa I'm speaking only from my own experience here - not an 
  'expert' on all things HTMX or hyperscript, so please take it with a grain of
  salt! ðŸ˜‰
  
  I use HTMX to handle interactions 'beyond the local page': when you have to 
  send/receive data to/from the backend, an external server or an API. If you 
  want to implement local interactivity and animations that use elements and 
  data that are already on the page, then you can just use hyperscript. In some
  cases, you might want to use both together - eg., as the user types into your
  form you can play a little animation using hyperscript, and then when they 
  submit it you use HTMX to send the data and display the response. HTMX and 
  hyperscript were made to play nicely with together.
