### Daniel, <cite>A Tour of myPrayerJournal v3: Conclusion</cite>

The thrilling conclusion to the  Prayer Journal Pentalogy.

Daniel - East TN: BTW - I can't remember who said they weren't sure about 
  writing about their code publicly. But, whoever you are, in this post I 
  actually talk poorly about my own code. üôÇ
Daniel - East TN: They can't talk bad about you if you beat them to it! LOL

If you've made anything with htmx/_hyperscript, **please share it!** It's 
lovely to hear from you. üíô

> HTMX is a library that allows you to access modern browser features directly

> suited to server-side rendering because it works by replacing sections of the
> DOM directly from remote responses. It seems to be well used and appreciated
> by the Python community.

## The new _hyperscript Cheatsheet

Keeping all the features of event listeners, ways of finding elements, the intricacies of variable scopes and the syntax of every single command just a glance away --- the _hyperscript cheatsheet!

Fubarrr: [Re. CapnKernel: That's awesome!  _You're_ awesome!] Awww, shucks,
  thanks! Yes, I do indeed take full credit for the fact that there now exists
  a probably 90% complete Hyperscript Cheatsheet üòé. I mean, do you know how 
  hard it is to create a whole Google doc from scratch, complete with title and
  single ‚ÄúTBC‚Äù line‚Ä¶ and remembering (aka googling) how to share it so anyone 
  can edit it?! To be fair, I guess a little credit should go to 
  @Deniz Ak≈üim≈üek for his very small contribution (although I did find it a bit
  cheeky of him tbh üôÑ) of replacing my ‚ÄúTBC‚Äù line with 2 pages of actual 
  cheatsheet content. Still, much like Edison is remembered for inventing the
  lightbulb, I shall go down in the annals of history as The Creator of The
  Hyperscript Cheatsheet ‚Ñ¢

## Avoid listening to `htmx:load` when you have big responses

{{#> chatlog time='20211216T1952+03' url='725789699527933952/796428329531605032/921082469103583285'}}
Fubarrr: Btw... remember that thing I said before about htmx swapping faster
  than intercooler? For some reason, if I'm swapping a bunch of `<option>` 
  elements into about 15 selects with htmx... the browser freezes for several
  seconds
--- {{ datetime '20211216T2121+03' }} ---
Fubarrr: Ok folks, so after @1cg and @Deniz Ak≈üim≈üek had a look at the 
  profiling... turns out that it's our codebase that's to blame for that crazy
  7.2 s scripting time on page load ‚òùÔ∏è , NOT htmx üòÅ ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Deniz Ak≈üim≈üek: new htmx best practice just dropped: avoid htmx:load for 
  responses containing large numbers of elements
{{/ chatlog}}


## How to submit an htmx form using JavaScript?

TL;DR: Use `form.requestSubmit()` instead of `form.submit()`.

{{#> chatlog time='20211216T1146+03' url='725789699527933952/725789747212976259/920960095662276618'}}
Deniz Ak≈üim≈üek: anyone who had trouble submitting an htmx form with JS: <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLFormElement/requestSubmit>

## Wrt. the `closest` expression

{{#> chatlog time='20211210T1452+03' url='725789699527933952/796428329531605032/918832424161521675'}}
1cg: closest means "closest in parent hierarchy": <https://api.jquery.com/closest/>
--- {{ datetime '20211210T2034+03' }} ---
c-nv-s: hmm... I think the use of `next` makes the same sense as it does in 
  english, but not `closest`. 
c-nv-s: If I understand correctly, it's meaning is more like equivalent 
  (hierarchically speaking)?
c-nv-s: ...at least in my mind 'closest' usually has a spatial connotation
1cg: I took the terminology from jQuery.  Too baked into my mind at this point
1cg: I could allow for a closest child <whatever/> form, maybe
Deniz Ak≈üim≈üek: [Re. 1cg: I took the terminology...] `enclosing` would perhaps 
  be a better name for `closest`
benpate: It would be. It's the constant _hyperscript dilemma of choosing 
  "natural language" vs. "what Javascript has already defined".  In this case,
  "closest" (although not a good natural language label) is already widely 
  used.
Deniz Ak≈üim≈üek: it's not that common
Fubarrr: 37 billion jquery users would argue with you @Deniz Ak≈üim≈üek üòÅ
Deniz Ak≈üim≈üek: most hyperscripters don't use event delegation (they should) 
  which is the main use case
Fubarrr: (not an accurate number, but a close approximation, judging by the
  number of jquery questions/answer on stackoverflow)
benpate: üçø
Deniz Ak≈üim≈üek: generally if code affects a whole component it should either be
  at its root or send events that bubble there 
  <span class=reaction><span class=emoji>‚òùÔ∏è</span> 1</span> <!-- hack, FIXME emoji detection-->
Deniz Ak≈üim≈üek: not reach out from a descendant to the root to manipulate it
Fubarrr: That said... I have had to think hard about what "closest" means again
  more than once... I agree it's ambiguous
Deniz Ak≈üim≈üek: 
  > component

  the framework brain worms are paying the old flowerpot a visit

What do you think about `closest`?


## tables ü§Æ

{{#> chatlog time='20211208T0702+03' url='725789699527933952/864934037381971988/917989443653230592'}}
1cg: AHHHH
1cg: that form tag isn't legal
1cg: it isn't even in the dom I bet
1cg: tables ü§Æ
