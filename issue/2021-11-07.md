## Michael Anckaert used htmx for a CI/CD service

> I picked server side rendered HTML as the main technology for the user

> Vue or React. Using <strong>HTMX</strong> makes me very productive on the

## Daniel shared an (unreleased) htmx library for F#

{{#> chatlog time='20211103T0214' url='725789699527933952/725789747212976259/905233356617314314'}}
Daniel - East TN: This is not quite ready for release, but all that I have left
  is packaging and automation for its first (pre)release. https://github.com/bit-badger/Giraffe.Htmx \
  \
  It's the shared library result of my experiment, already fielded, in 
  converting a Vue application to an "htmx SPA". The README describes it and 
  has examples. It brings htmx awareness to Giraffe (the F# web server that 
  sits atop ASP.NET Core) and its view engine (which produces HTML via 
  strongly-typed functions). \
  \
  Once I get this (pre)release done, I'll be ready to start on the (promised, 
  and intro post already drafted) write-up of how it went. [üëë2]
1cg: vue to htmx experience!  Very much looking forward to hearing how it went!

So am I, Carson! My sources tell me that the library will be released soon&trade;.

## How to submit data from a form in _hyperscript

Deniz Ak≈üim≈üek: should be a matter of 
  <figure>
  
  ~~~ hyperscript
  make a FormData from #form
  fetch /url { method: "POST", body: result }
  ~~~
  </figure>
  
  in the upcoming release it will become
  <figure>
  
  ~~~ hyperscript
  make a FormData from #form
  fetch /url with method: "POST", body: result

## _hyperscript vs Alpine.js

{{#> chatlog time='20211105T2107+03' url='725789699527933952/864934037381971988/906243399634526218'}}
Deniz Ak≈üim≈üek: [Re. Rashad: For those that have used hyperscript and Alpine.js 
  with TailwindCSS...] Microinteractions are one of the main use cases for _. 
  Alpine fixes the "where's that event listener" problem, but does nothing 
  about the DOM APIs. \
  I think alpine is better for larger components like data tables, because of 
  x-for and reactivity. For microinteractions, you will need to manipulate the 
  DOM directly a lot more, which is a dream in hyperscript.

_Editor's note: Let me make it clear that this is not a dig on Alpine in any 
way. I gave my personal opinion to help people decide what to use. We're 
volunteer-run free software projects with a lot of shared goals. üíô_


## a Hotwire-like library based on htmx?

{{#> chatlog time='20211105T1720+03' url='725789699527933952/864934037381971988/906186310342029343'}}
gone: Is there any desire to make a hotwire like lib that uses htmx?
gone: Hotmx [üëç1]
KevinS: Just on the name alone it should be built, doesn't matter if it meets a
  demand the name is too good üòÑ
1cg: hotmax [üî•3]
Atem: hxwire

Would you use that? Let us know.
