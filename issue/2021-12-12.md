Daniel - East TN: BTW - I can't remember who said they weren't sure about 
  writing about their code publicly. But, whoever you are, in this post I 
  actually talk poorly about my own code. üôÇ
Daniel - East TN: They can't talk bad about you if you beat them to it! LOL

## Wrt. the `closest` expression

1cg: closest means "closest in parent hierarchy": <https://api.jquery.com/closest/>

c-nv-s: hmm... I think the use of `next` makes the same sense as it does in 
  english, but not `closest`. 
c-nv-s: If I understand correctly, it's meaning is more like equivalent 
  (hierarchically speaking)?
c-nv-s: ...at least in my mind 'closest' usually has a spatial connotation
1cg: I took the terminology from jQuery.  Too baked into my mind at this point
1cg: I could allow for a closest child <whatever/> form, maybe
Deniz Ak≈üim≈üek: [Re. 1cg: I took the terminology...] `enclosing` would perhaps 
  be a better name for `closest`
benpate: It would be. It's the constant _hyperscript dilemma of choosing 
  "natural language" vs. "what Javascript has already defined".  In this case,
  "closest" (although not a good natural language label) is already widely 
  used.
Deniz Ak≈üim≈üek: it's not that common
Fubarrr: 37 billion jquery users would argue with you @Deniz Ak≈üim≈üek üòÅ
Deniz Ak≈üim≈üek: most hyperscripters don't use event delegation (they should) 
  which is the main use case
Fubarrr: (not an accurate number, but a close approximation, judging by the
  number of jquery questions/answer on stackoverflow)
benpate: üçø
Deniz Ak≈üim≈üek: generally if code affects a whole component it should either be
  at its root or send events that bubble there 
  <span class=reaction><span class=emoji>‚òùÔ∏è</span> 1</span> <!-- hack, FIXME emoji detection-->
Deniz Ak≈üim≈üek: not reach out from a descendant to the root to manipulate it
Fubarrr: That said... I have had to think hard about what "closest" means again
  more than once... I agree it's ambiguous
Deniz Ak≈üim≈üek: 
  > component

  the framework brain worms are paying the old flowerpot a visit

What do you think about `closest`?

1cg: AHHHH
1cg: that form tag isn't legal
1cg: it isn't even in the dom I bet
1cg: tables ü§Æ
