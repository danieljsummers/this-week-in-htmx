### Dan Jacob, <cite>Django, HTMX and Alpine</cite>

> A sufficiently skilled team can of course mitigate all of these problems; but
> most teams do not have sufficient skill (or time and resources) to build a
> such a high quality SPA.

> The problem however is not with the SPA architecture itself, but rather the
> current dominant mindset of SPA as the default paradigm for all web projects,
> rather than one possible approach among many others for careful consideration
> based on the requirements of the project and the skills of the development
> team. That's why libraries such as HTMX and Alpine are a great addition to
> your toolkit.

### The New Stack, <cite>Htmx: HTML Approach to Interactivity in a JavaScript World</cite>

An interview with our own Carson on htmx that introduces the library, and the
SPA/MPA drama surrounding Rich Harris's talk.

<aside>

I didn't want to talk about Twitter drama, as it's the worst kind of flamewar
that can exist, which is partly why this issue is so short despite being a
month late.

## Hyperwordle

After [typehand][], a typing speed test, community member Arham Jain wrote a
Wordle clone in hyperscript, replicating most of the functionality in a ~60
LOC HTML file that is fully view-sourceable. (Take a look --- there's some
clever stuff in there!)

The game made it to [The Orange Site][], where it made it to the frontpage.

One DEV.to member wrote a counterpart in Elm and used it to compare the two
languages. The resulting article, [<cite>Elm vs HyperScript - A Wordle
implementation</cite>][elm-vs], is a joyous exhibit of how hilarious the
\_hyperscript project is.

## Ben Pate is building a personal publishing platform on htmx & _hyperscript

## Request synchronization in htmx

> A common problem in AJAX driven applications is synchronization: how to two
> elements on a page synchronize the requests that they need to make with one
> another. Currently htmx offers no mechanisms for synchronizing multiple
> element requests. This document will explore some ideas for doing so. The goal
> is to provide both declarative synchronization as well as scripting access to
> htmx-driven requests.

Carson wrote up this proposal detailing the design of the future `hx-sync`
attribute. What do you think?

## HDB improvements

The \_hyperscript debugger now has the ability to jump back and forth between
commands. See the demo below:

Have you ever used HDB? If not, why not?


## Dan Jacob implemented the <cite>Real World</cite> demo app with htmx

For those that didn't know (like myself), Real World is a standardized demo app
that aims to be a more sophisticated alternative to TodoMVC, showcasing features
that real-world apps often need.

Thanks to Dan Jacob <<https://danjacob.net/>>, now htmx has an implementation of
it too! The source code is here:

And a discussion of the project:

## Ben's _hyperscript widgets collection

With <s>coercion</s> encouragement from the community, Ben has built a file
uploader, a modal window and tabs in \_hyperscript.

> In keeping with general htmx principles, we will endeavor to create code
> that is:
>
>  * Usable
>  * Accessible
>  * Un-Scalable
