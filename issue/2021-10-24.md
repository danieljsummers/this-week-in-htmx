## 3 htmx talks were given at DjangoCon US 2021!

The conference over this weekend featured these talks from members of the htmx
community:

-   [<cite>Server-Side is Dead! Long Live Server-Side (+ HTMX)</cite>][talk1] 
    by [Jack Linke]
    > By the end of this talk, audience members will have a better understanding
    > of what HTMX is, will understand concrete examples of how it can be 
    > applied to their django projects, and will have a list of resources for
    > further learning and discussion.
    >
    > Outline:
    > 
    >   - The current state: [...]
    >   - One potential approach: [...]
    >   - Feature and approach walk-throughs For a variety of common web application features [...]
    >   - Tips, best practices, and pitfalls: [...]

-   [<cite>HTMX: Frontend Revolution</cite>][talk2] by [Thomas G√ºttler]
    > I developed my first CGI script in 1998. Since that day I have seen a lot 
    > of hypes coming and going.
    > 
    > The talk will consist of three parts:
    >   - My humorous odyssey of trying to find a great frontend framework
    >   - Retrospective: What do I want from the frontend?
    >   - I finally found: HTMX: HTML Fragments over the wire
    >   -  How to use HTMX with Django.
    >
    > Besides simplicity, good Web Vitals performance (SEO) is a benefit of 
    > this method. The talk will express my personal opinion, feelings 
    > and fun. It won‚Äôt dive into technical details.

-   [<cite>REST, HATEOAS & Django - It's OK to not use JSON... or Javascript</cite>][talk3]
    by [Carson Gross]
    > In this talk we will revisit the basics of REST (REpresentational State 
    > Transfer), a term coined by Roy Fielding to describe the web network 
    > architecture, in contrast with older client-server network architectures. 
    > In particular we will focus in on the ‚ÄúUniform Interface‚Äù constraint and
    > get to the bottom of what that means, discussing each of the following:
    >
    >   - Resource identification in requests
    >   - Resource manipulation through representations
    >   - Self-descriptive messages
    >   - Hypermedia as the engine of application state (HATEOAS)
    >
    > with a particular focus on the last two.

1cg: [...] if you told me a year ago that htmx would be involved in 3 of 39
  talks at djangocon 2021 I would have laughed at your crazy talk: I don't
  program in python and know next to nothing about django [...]

## Rashad started a lovely conversation about Haskell & htmx

{{#> chatlog time='20211023T1829+03' url='725789699527933952/725789747212976259/901492536168812544'}}  
Rashad: [...] I'm a web developer who uses Haskell and I wanted to start
  developing an HTML driven development ecosystem for the Haskel
  community. [...]  
{{/chatlog}}

The conversation is quite long, so I've put it inside this convenient `<details>`
element:

<details><summary>monadposting on main</summary>

{{#> chatlog time='20211023T1829+03' url='725789699527933952/725789747212976259/901492536168812544'}}  
Rashad: Okay very understandable. Low coupling is always nice. I ask the
  question because I'm a web developer who uses Haskell and I wanted to start
  developing an HTML driven development ecosystem for the Haskell community. I
  believe no programming community dislikes JavaScript more than the Haskell
  community, so Haskellers would love to use HTMX since it would allow them to
  stay in "Haskell world" as much as possible. We don't have anything like
  Livewire, LiveView, etc. so I was wondering if would even worth it to
  implement if HTMX exists. I myself have been using it in some small Haskell
  projects, one of them being a project actually used by a trucking company, and
  it has been an amazing experience. I'm using a library, which I plan on
  releasing soon along with a blog post for using HTMX+Haskell, that allows you
  to use HTMX attributes in a Haskell DSL called lucid.
  https://chrisdone.com/posts/lucid2/ has examples of what lucid looks like if
  you're interested. Interestingly, HTML is a monad!!  
Rashad: On top of that library, I'm also working on one that defines each HTMX
  attribute as a plain ol' algebraic data type and essentially allows me to
  check at compile time that the HTMX attribute values I'm using are
  syntactically correct. This is cool to me since we value type safety. Anyways,
  I think HTMX+Haskell is an awesome combo and I plan on writing a lot soon
  about the combination and would love to share here and with the rest of the
  Haskell community because a lot of my brothers and sisters in Haskell land
  still aren't really familiar with it.  
devsimplicity: [Re. Rashad: On top of that library...] That's pretty cool. It
  would probably be more attractive to haskellers if htmx is written in
  something like PureScript, but it's worth giving it a try. Good luck with
  your project.  
1cg: [Re. Rashad: Okay very understandable...] absolutely awesome  
1cg: I often think of hypermedia as a functional transform of the DOM  
1cg: if htmx makes programming for the web in Haskell more enjoyable, that'd be
  alright üôÇ  
1cg: Haskell and lisp: two programming languages I will never use but would love
  to help out  
Rashad: [Re. devsimplicity: That's pretty cool...] PureScript is a frontend
  language that compiles to JavaScript, so HTMX in PureScript would kind of
  defeat the purpose. You can use PureScript on the backend though. PureScript
  -> Node.js, but for the backend, Haskell is better unless you use PureScript
  for your frontend and want full-stack PureScript.  
devsimplicity: No, you misunderstood me. I was referring to the fact that
  haskellers don't like JS code (i.e. debugging or contributing to the
  underlying lib). PureScript kind of helps with that.  
Rashad: Oh yes my bad. I see exactly what you mean. Yeah if HTMX itself was
  written in PureScript, yeah that would be more attractive to Haskell
  developers. You are very correct.  
Deniz Ak≈üim≈üek: we can only write htmx in one language, and javascript is the
  most commonly known one  
Deniz Ak≈üim≈üek: if it was rewritten in another language it would probably be
  typescript  
Rashad: Yeah, no need to write it in PureScript haha At the end of the day it
  doesn't really matter from the user's perspective. PureScript tends to
  generate pretty inefficient JavaScript code, so performance and the size of
  HTMX would take a hit.

## tinycode2 talked about using htmx with microfrontends

{{#> chatlog time='20211020T1629+03' url='725789699527933952/725789747212976259/900375210132373544' }}
tinycode2: Is there a way to bind URL to changes to page state via htmx?
alejandros: You can update the URL from the server side using the HX-Push
  header <https://htmx.org/reference/#response_headers> and you can also do it
  on the client side via htmx-push-url <https://htmx.org/attributes/hx-push-url/>
tinycode2: Ok but what if I have several areas which update different parts of
  the URL?  
tinycode2: E.g. query string arguments  
1cg: ideally they would each have a hx-push-url that updated the local URL
  appropriately or relied on the server to return the correct URL in an HX-Push
  header  
alejandros: For complex cases, I use the header. htmx always sends the current
  URL in the request headers so you can take that, change it, then send it
  back. [üî•1]  
tinycode2: In my case I'm using micro-frontends so responsibility for query
  string components (and html rendering) isn't centralised in a single backend
  service. I guess I'll need to build some sort of aggregating proxy server
  which does this :/  
tinycode2:  Actually the model you suggested should also work for
  microfrrontends @alejandros

## Daniel made Bootstrap modals work with htmx

{{#> chatlog time='20201021T1622+03' url='725789699527933952/725789747212976259/900735911430598726'}}  
Daniel - East TN: FWIW - this is "doing it wrong". I put an hx-get on the
  button that launches the modal, targeting the body of the modal; then, I
  return the HTML fragment from the server. All the htmx stuff works like it
  should again. üôÇ  
{{/  chatlog }}

And later:

{{#> chatlog time='20211024T1757+03' url='725789699527933952/725789747212976259/901665739243659304' }}  
Daniel - East TN: I'll definitely have to write up what I've learned doing this.
  [...]  
{{/ chatlog }}

We're excited for it, Daniel! No pressure though...


## An inconsistency in _hyperscript syntax was fixed

Currently, the `send` command can dispatch events on other elements, but 
`trigger` cannot:

  ~~~ hyperscript
  send evt            -- works, dispatches on "me"
  send evt to #elt    -- works, dispatches on #elt
  trigger evt         -- works, dispatches on "me"
  trigger evt on #elt -- syntax error!
  ~~~

This will no longer be the case in the next release of _hyperscript.

## htmx & \_hyperscript were mentioned on [devMode.fm]

devMode already has [an episode on htmx] featuring Carson, but the latest 
episode mentions it as well, near the end.

> Andrew Welch: You've heard of HTMX?
>
> Ryan Irelan: Yes, but I can't for the life of me-
>
> AW: So, HTMX ---real quick, like thirty seconds--- HTMX ---this is going to be
> not on the show anyway--- HTMX is basically- Carson, the guy who made it, kind
> of considers HTML, the standards body, stopped, and they really needed to do 
> more to allow for some dynamicism [sic] and he is kind of on your page in 
> terms of that he thinks these libraries and things are a bit crazy. So, he
> wrote an extension to HTML that kind of fills in the missing gaps and allows 
> for that interactivity and stuff. It's a really interesting library and we did
> a show on it if you ever want to listen about it. But then, he also -- this is
> the question I want to ask you about, and you can just think about it -- he's
> also working on a project _\_hyperscript_ which is like HyperTalk from the old
> HyperCard days. So, it's an interpreted language that you put in your browser
> that JavaScript then interprets and decodes and runs. And I think it's just 
> absolutely crazy <i>[laughter]</i> but anyway, 
> 
> RI: That's weird. I'm gonna have to check that.

üíô to the devMode.fm podcast! (and apologies for my mediocre transcription

## Richard appreciated syntax highlighting for _hyperscript

{{#> chatlog time='20211018T2154+03' url='725789699527933952/796428329531605032/899732227053719573' }}  
RichardG: Yes indeed, is fun üôÇ and the syntax highlighting in VSCode helps a
  ton  
RichardG: Phpstorm doesn't seem to have it, that I can find?  
{{/ chatlog}}

![It highlights code inside of HTML, even marks event names!
](/assets/2021-10-24/vscode-hyperscript.png)

The _hyperscript plugin for Visual Studio Code adds syntax highlighting, even
for code embedded in HTML! The newest version supports _hyperscript in Markdown
code blocks. Try it out:

  - <https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dz4k.vscode-hyperscript-org>
  - <https://open-vsx.org/extension/dz4k/vscode-hyperscript-org>

I've also just started writing a tree-sitter grammar, for those who are into
_that_ sort of thing: <https://github.com/dz4k/tree-sitter-_hyperscript>
