## 3 htmx talks were given at DjangoCon US 2021!

The conference over this weekend featured these talks from members of the htmx
community:

-   [<cite>Server-Side is Dead! Long Live Server-Side (+ HTMX)</cite>][talk1] 
    by [Jack Linke]
    > By the end of this talk, audience members will have a better understanding
    > of what HTMX is, will understand concrete examples of how it can be 
    > applied to their django projects, and will have a list of resources for
    > further learning and discussion.
    >
    > Outline:
    > 
    >   - The current state: [...]
    >   - One potential approach: [...]
    >   - Feature and approach walk-throughs For a variety of common web application features [...]
    >   - Tips, best practices, and pitfalls: [...]

-   [<cite>HTMX: Frontend Revolution</cite>][talk2] by [Thomas Güttler]
    > I developed my first CGI script in 1998. Since that day I have seen a lot 
    > of hypes coming and going.
    > 
    > The talk will consist of three parts:
    >   - My humorous odyssey of trying to find a great frontend framework
    >   - Retrospective: What do I want from the frontend?
    >   - I finally found: HTMX: HTML Fragments over the wire
    >   -  How to use HTMX with Django.
    >
    > Besides simplicity, good Web Vitals performance (SEO) is a benefit of 
    > this method. &para; The talk will express my personal opinion, feelings 
    > and fun. It won’t dive into technical details.

-   [<cite>REST, HATEOAS & Django - It's OK to not use JSON... or Javascript</cite>][talk3]
    by [Carson Gross]
    > In this talk we will revisit the basics of REST (REpresentational State 
    > Transfer), a term coined by Roy Fielding to describe the web network 
    > architecture, in contrast with older client-server network architectures. 
    > In particular we will focus in on the “Uniform Interface” constraint and
    > get to the bottom of what that means, discussing each of the following:
    >
    >   - Resource identification in requests
    >   - Resource manipulation through representations
    >   - Self-descriptive messages
    >   - Hypermedia as the engine of application state (HATEOAS)
    >
    > with a particular focus on the last two.

1cg: [...] if you told me a year ago that htmx would be involved in 3 of 39 
  talks at djangocon 2021 I would have laughed at your crazy talk: I don't 
  program in python and know next to nothing about django [...]

## tinycode2 is using htmx with microfrontends

{{#> chatlog time='20211020T1629+3' url='725789699527933952/725789747212976259/900375210132373544' }}
tinycode2: Is there a way to bind URL to changes to page state via htmx?
alejandros: You can update the URL from the server side using the HX-Push
  header <https://htmx.org/reference/#response_headers> and you can also do it 
  on the client side via htmx-push-url <https://htmx.org/attributes/hx-push-url/>
tinycode2: Ok but what if I have several areas which update different parts of 
  the URL?
tinycode2: E.g. query string arguments
1cg: ideally they would each have a hx-push-url that updated the local URL 
  appropriately or relied on the server to return the correct URL in an HX-Push
  header
alejandros: For complex cases, I use the header. htmx always sends the current 
  URL in the request headers so you can take that, change it, then send it 
  back. [🔥1]
tinycode2: In my case I'm using micro-frontends so responsibility for query 
  string components (and html rendering) isn't centralised in a single backend
  service. I guess I'll need to build some sort of aggregating proxy server 
  which does this :/
tinycode2:  Actually the model you suggested should also work for 
  microfrrontends @alejandros

## Daniel made Bootstrap modals work with htmx

{{#> chatlog time='20201021T1622+03' url='725789699527933952/725789747212976259/900735911430598726'}}
Daniel - East TN: FWIW - this is "doing it wrong". I put an hx-get on the 
  button that launches the modal, targeting the body of the modal; then, I 
  return the HTML fragment from the server. All the htmx stuff works like it 
  should again. 🙂

## An inconsistency in _hyperscript syntax was fixed

Currently, the `send` command can dispatch events on other elements, but 
`trigger` cannot:

  ~~~ hyperscript
  send evt            -- works, dispatches on "me"
  send evt to #elt    -- works, dispatches on #elt
  trigger evt         -- works, dispatches on "me"
  trigger evt on #elt -- syntax error!
  ~~~

This will no longer be the case in the next release of _hyperscript.

## Richard appreciated syntax highlighting for _hyperscript

{{#> chatlog time='20211018T2154+03' url='725789699527933952/796428329531605032/899732227053719573' }}
RichardG: Yes indeed, is fun 🙂 and the syntax highlighting in VSCode helps a 
  ton
RichardG: Phpstorm doesn't seem to have it, that I can find?

![Some _hyperscript code inside of HTML, nicely highlighted](/assets/2021-10-24/vscode-hyperscript.png)

The _hyperscript plugin for Visual Studio Code adds syntax highlighting, even
for code embedded in HTML! The newest version supports _hyperscript in Markdown
code blocks. Try it out:

<https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dz4k.vscode-hyperscript-org>

I've also just started writing a tree-sitter grammar, for those who are into
_that_ sort of thing:
