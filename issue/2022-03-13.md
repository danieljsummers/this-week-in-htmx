## Our newest corporate sponsor: JetBrains

Yes, _that_ JetBrains.

absolutely floored to say that htmx has a new corporate sponsor... @jetbrains!

i have been a long time (20+ years) user of all of JetBrain's tools and it is 
positively surreal to have them as a sponsor

thank you @jetbrains!

gnat: @1cg jetbrains sponsor mean we'll get hyperscript highlighting there? üòâ 
  If so, that's 3 major editors, good job!

  1. Jetbrains
  2. VScode
  3. Sublime
gnat: That's pretty fair coverage

gagepeterson: As far as which forum software I think GitHub discussions is 
  probably the easiest to implement. I think I like Discourse's notification 
  system, since last visit line, and obviously has a lot more plugins and 
  features than GitHub discussions. However hosting ourselves is a bit more 
  difficult to manage I admit.\
  \
  There's also nodeBB which has pretty slick UX. Pretty sure I can even be 
  embedded into the static website if we wanted. Looks like they'll even host 
  it for free for open source projects: <https://nodebb.org/pricing/>

gagepeterson: Also looks like Twist is free for communities:

gagepeterson: It's got really great web, desktop, and mobile app. Not publicly
  searchable but best in class UX

xpufx: If leaving Discord ever becomes an option at all please consider Zulip.
  <https://zulip.com/> It's open source. Can be self hosted. But they also do 
  provide free cloud hosting for open source projecst if I am not mistaken. 
xpufx: Its killer feature is it's topic based threads. (every channel 
  conversation requires a topic) 
xpufx: Yes it is in fact free for open source projects. <https://zulip.com/for/open-source/>
  Refer to the "Lasting knowledge repository " section on this page for info 
  relating to the topic of this thread.

Craig R: Wonder if this might be somewhat suitable? Seems like a hybrid forum
  and chat: <https://www.talkyard.io/>
lllama: <https://www.discourse.org/> ?

Do you have any ideas?


## missing.css progress

The missing.css website has a new font switcher. ƒ∞n addition: we are looking 
into navbar-free navigation, because navbars are a pain.

Meanwhile, we are progressing on the front of covering all the elements.

One thing still undecided is the utility class part --- if you have used 
utility-based CSS and have opinions about it, <https://htmx.org/discord> is the
soapbox you've been looking for! Ignore that buzzƒ±ng noise. üêù

This could turn out to be good.

## The maintainability of _hyperscript code

{{#> chatlog time='20220301T0141+03' url='725789699527933952/796428329531605032/947986864093134908'}}
Fubarrr: Just wanted to say how much I love the maintainability of hyperscript
  code!\
  Today I discovered a small issue with some code I wrote months ago.\
  Took all of 30 seconds to find the problematic line of code ('cause LoB), 
  understand what it was doing ('cause hyperscript syntax is poetry) and roll
  in a fix.
