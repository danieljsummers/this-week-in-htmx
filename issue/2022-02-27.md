The release also includes:
 - Server-Send Events and WebSocket support was factored into extensions,
 - the new Alpine-Morph plugin, which preserves Alpine state during htmx swaps
 - the Restored plugin, which lets elements know when they've been restored
   from the history cache
 - the Loading States plugin, which helps you show loading to the user

That's _still_ not all! Read the full release notes:

Intercooler is still maintained, but htmx provides new features and will
continue to gain more. As such, you might want to port your intercooler apps to
htmx + \_hyperscript, which you can do with this guide.

The guide features such gems as:

> htmx follows the approach of trying to keep the core small, with a smaller set
> of available attributes that are mostly focused on content loading and
> swapping.

> Using the htmx events system with vanilla javascript, alpine.js or
> hyperscript. Hyperscript is a small, open scripting language designed to be
> embedded in HTML, inspired by HyperTalk and is a companion project of htmx.

> None. No direct equivalent functionality exists (TBC)

MSM: I've been building a thing for work using the https://arc.codes/
  framework, and noticed that they have started to advise that lambdas/functions
  should return HTML rather than JSON. there was this interesting line in
  https://fwa.dev/before-and-after that seems HOWLy:

> A different way to solve all this complexity is to move up the cloud vendor
> stack. A Functional Web App (FWA) is authored completely as
> single-responsibility cloud functions that can render HTML-first dynamically,
> incorporating the full-stack such as a managed database.

Interesting...
